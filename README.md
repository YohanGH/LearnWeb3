# LearnWeb3 Repository

## About

This repository is dedicated to exercises from the LearnWeb3 platform. It is designed to help me practice and solidify my understanding of blockchain development, focusing particularly on decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum network. Each exercise is crafted to build specific skills, from frontend development to smart contract programming and integration.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a distinct exercise or module from the LearnWeb3 curriculum. Below is a general outline of the structure:


Each subdirectory within these sections will contain all the files and instructions necessary to complete that particular exercise, including code, README files specific to the exercise, and any required assets or configurations.
